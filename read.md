# Project Name - 
FamilyAAFFair

FamilyAAffair combines convenience, family-specific services, and rewards to create a more tailored and attractive booking experience for families, promoting both passenger satisfaction and loyalty. More benefits include increased operational efficiency, leading to happier airline employees. Lastly, it allows American Airlines to have a competitive advantage in the family traveling market.

## Tech Overview 💻
**... what tech was used to bring this project to life?**
This project was brought to life using React Native, Node JS, and utilizng Email.JS  
API to confirm family registaration once flights are booked. In addition, we used an implementation of an Matrix Factorization Algorithm to show families which seats can accomodate their family booking arrangement which was used to on a scale of an Boeing 737.

Example:
* React Native 
* Email.JS Api
* Matrix Factorization Algorithm
